Frau Melhase and I were heading to the Rammstein concert in our Porsche when she told me that we had forgotten our lederhose and bratwurst. 
We decided to go back to retrieve them and also to grab some brot, so we made a u-turn and went back down the hauptstrasse. We stopped by the baeckerei to get the brot, and decided to also get some gebaeck and apfelkuchen. After getting home and retrieving our lederhose, we decided to bring our hund and got back into our porsche.
